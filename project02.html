              <p class="lead">Water-Man is a unity third-person perspective 3D shooting puzzle-solving game
                 that consists of three levels in total. The game involves the
                 player use strategies to solve different puzzles. At the same time,
                 the game contains a shooting game’s element.
              </p>

              <p class="lead">The player will use a
              water gun to kill enemies. Compared with other 3D puzzle-solving
              games, the most unique part of the game is that players can interact
              with water. Moreover, the game objects and puzzles are related to the element of water.</p>

               The reason we choose ‘W’ ‘S’ ‘A’ ‘D’ over the arrow key(↑,↓,→,←)
               is that we found some keyboards have very small arrow keys such
               as apple magic keyboard. It is hard for the player to control the
               character’s movement. Another reason is that the player needs to
               use the mouse to shoot enemies and press the 'spacebar' to jump.

            <p >The main goal of the first level is to provide a general understanding
              of the game for the player as well as a narrative story of the game.
               Thus, this level does not have many puzzles for the player to solve.
               The player will learn basic game mechanics in the first level such as
               how to move and attack the enemies. They will have enough time to explore
                the game environment.

            <p >The second and third level is mainly focused on puzzle-solving and battles with enemies. The player needs to find the triggers to activate the switch in order to proceed. Besides, the player needs to kill enemies to avoid their attacks. The player will learn the unique skill at the beginning of the third level. Then, there are several puzzles that allow the player to interact with using the skill.

The ramp-up rhythm of the game will bring feelings of enjoyment and achievement for the player. Besides, I created an animated cut scene for the victory. The player can see it after they clean up the third level.

          <h4>Meterial</h4>
          <p>The project use different materials. For example,
            I use sandpaper to sand the form to the manipulation of
             pink foam. This material allow me to create an organic
             shape. I use the pink foam to create the main supporting
             parts of the sniper shotgun. I use hot up the glue gun to
              glue the pieces that we need. I have also used aluminum tape
               to fake the PVC tube into a metal rod and 3D printer to make a bullet holder.

          <h4>Process</h4>
          <p>I have used gold, bronze silver metallic paint for detail
            painting after the black coating is dried out. One of the challenges
             that I have met is that the paints might be too limited in terms of
             variety. So I decided to mix the paint and create some marks of age on
             top of the other paints. I have learned that it is a good thing to paint
              after the assembly of all the parts. The project also taught me lots of
               handcraft skills and good painting skills.
